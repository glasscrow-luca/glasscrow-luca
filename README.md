- 👋 Hi, I’m @glasscrow-luca
- 👀 I’m interested in building code or software that will help make people's lives easier.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Object-Oriented Programming in both Python and Java, while dabbling in data retrieval and management with Python. I want to become either an Android Developer or Backend/Full Stack Developer. I already know HTML and CSS!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything involving the above technologies! I need practice!
- 📫 How to reach me: rokulie@gmail.com
- ✨ Coding is FUN! I wish I'd majored in programming instead of design!
